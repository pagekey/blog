Let's take a look at the big plans for switching over the Boom Languages client from Flutter to React Native. It'll be a complete re-implementation, so it'll be a fair amount of work, but hopefully I can knock it out one tiny piece at at time.

You can try the current version of the Boom Languages app at [https://boomlanguages.com](https://boomlanguages.com). You can also find it on Android and iOS stores.

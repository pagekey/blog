In this video, we get our hands dirty and implement the "version" and "registration info" endpoints in the new React Native client for Boom Languages.

You can try the current version of the Boom Languages app at [https://boomlanguages.com/](https://boomlanguages.com/). You can also find it on Android and iOS stores.

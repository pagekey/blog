Here's the latest for Boom Languages, a new language learning app I'm working on.

I just finished getting Version 2.0.0 on all app stores and the web. The main new feature is an "article translation" tool. It works, but as you'll see, it's pretty buggy.

If you'd like to try it out, visit [https://boomlanguages.com](https://boomlanguages.com).

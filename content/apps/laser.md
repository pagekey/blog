Our first foray into the world of app-making, Laser gives you some tools to track your day-to-day cash transactions.

With this app, you can:

1) Create an unlimited number of Transactions, which will be automatically summed to display your balance.

2) Create Scheduled Transactions, which allow you to automate the entry of common transactions, such as salary, food purchase, etc.

3) Organize Transactions and Scheduled Transactions by categories you create.

4) Visualize your budget with charts showing your Earned and Spent totals, organized by category.

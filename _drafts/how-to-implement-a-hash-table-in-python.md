Hash tables are great for so many interesting programming problems. I always love to incorporate a hash table into a problem, and they can provide a clean solution to an issue that would be a mess otherwise.

For the longest time, I wondered how hash tables were created. I wanted to make my own, but didn't know how. Luckily, I found [James Routley's awesome post](https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table) detailing how to implement one in C.

Need a quick run down on a classic data structure? Look no further.

A linked list is an ordered collection of elements. The thing that makes it special is how it stores data. Behind the scenes, each number, string, object, or other value you may need to keep track of is stored in a Node. Each Node references its successor.

In this case, we will be talking about a **singly linked list**, meaning that each node only has one reference, to the **next** node. For a __doubly linked list__, there would be an additional reference to the **previous** node.

Sometimes, I have trouble prioritizing my tasks. My day becomes a whirlwind of talking to a lot of different people working on very different projects. I would often get stressed out, as I'd start to work on one thing, get pulled away, and forget where I left off, or even what I was working on!

I needed a system to keep my head on straight. I had played with [Kanban Flow]() at home and found it to be incredibly useful. To my dismay, the firewall at work blocked the site, so I had to find another option.

I turned to OneNote, Microsoft's notetaking software. As I tweaked my little wannabe Kanban Board, I was more and more impressed at the flexibility and utility of OneNote.

# Why Should I?

Maybe I'm asking too much here. It does require a few minutes of your time to get everything set up and working.

On the other hand, you may find that those minutes were a worthy investment as you power through work that you were once too frazzled to complete. Kanban is a powerful system, and even if it's heavily modified, this OneNote version could create some benefits for you.

Also, prioritization seems to be built in. Little handles on table rows allow you to drag tasks up and down and between tables as you see fit.

You'll see what I mean.

Sometimes, I have trouble prioritizing my tasks. My day becomes a whirlwind of talking to a lot of different people working on very different projects. I would often get stressed out, as I'd start to work on one thing, get pulled away, and forget where I left off, or even what I was working on!

I needed a system to keep my head on straight. I had played with [Kanban Flow]() at home and found it to be incredibly useful. To my dismay, the firewall at work blocked the site, so I had to find another option.

I turned to OneNote, Microsoft's notetaking software. As I tweaked my little wannabe Kanban Board, I was more and more impressed at the flexibility and utility of OneNote.

# Why Should I?

Maybe I'm asking too much here. It does require a few minutes of your time to get everything set up and working.

On the other hand, you may find that those minutes were a worthy investment as you power through work that you were once too frazzled to complete. Kanban is a powerful system, and even if it's heavily modified, this OneNote version could create some benefits for you.

Also, prioritization seems to be built in. Little handles on table rows allow you to drag tasks up and down and between tables as you see fit.

You'll see what I mean.

# Creating the Board

Let's get started. The first thing you'll need is a table. This will be the template for all tasks as they flow from the Backlog to Completed. Design this table in a way that makes sense for you. In my case, I like to use three columns: Project, Task, and Priority.

Open a new page and start typing the first column name. Press tab, and it should turn into a table. Type the next one, tab over, and repeat until you have all of the columns. Then, press enter.

Now that we have our table set up, we can copy it over. Click on the top of the table to highlight the whole thing. Next, press `Control-C` and `Control-V` to copy and paste this table. I would recommend creating a total of four boards to start with.

Align your new boards horizontally, and put a name above each. Call them Backlog, Waiting, Working, and Completed.

It looks like we're all set up. Now we can put it to good use.

# Using the Board

Create your first task. Click in your Backlog board, fill out each column, and press tab to create a blank row after it. It's always a good idea to leave a blank row in there, so that you always have a place to start your tasks from.

Now let's take a second to imagine this task getting done. We see it on our board and think it's pretty important. So, we start working it. To do this, we hover to the left of the row to reveal a little anchor, which we can use to click and drag between tables.

The task moves from Backlog to Working, where we spend some time getting it done. Then, we find ourselves waiting for someone else to complete work on it before we continue, so we move it to Waiting. Come on, John - Check your email already!

With great patience, we wait for John and are finally able to complete our task.

# Variations on this Method

As with anything productivity related, you have to figure out what works for you.

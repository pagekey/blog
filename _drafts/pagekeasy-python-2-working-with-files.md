I'm glad you made your way back to PageKeasy Python, Part 2. In this lesson, we'll be discussing the tools you'll need to open, read from, and properly close files in Python. There are some subtle differences between versions that we'll cover. When we finish, you'll have one of the most important foundational blocks laid for processing massive amount of data, parsing, and automating to your heart's content.

# Open

Before you can do anything to a file, you have to open it up. This bascially lets Python know that it should get it work on all the details in the background so that the file is ready to provide data to your program.

Don't forget that there are different modes for editing. The most important ones are 'r', 'w', and 'a', which stand for "read", "write", and "append" respectively.

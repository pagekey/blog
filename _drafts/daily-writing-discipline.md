Writing is rewriting. This is what I keep hearing, left and right, when I read about how people actually get articles, essays, and books out the door. Apparently, one of the most important you need in order to be a successful writer is a consistent writing habit. This month, I started my journey of finding my habit.

I was amazed when I checked my blog and saw that I've actually been writing articles on-and-off for about a year now. I would get inspired, force myself to bang out a few technical articles, and then the inspiration would leave me. A few months would pass, and the cycle would begin again. Instead of waiting for inspiration to strike to begin writing, though, I believe you have to write anything; only then will what you want to write come to you. There's no other way to find out.

I've been writing on-and-off for about a year now on various technical topics, managing to squeeze out an article here and there every few months. For a while, I managed to do a weekly how-to article. Despite these small successes, I would always fall of with it after a few days or weeks.

I've still yet to see the effects of my new discipline, and if I'll keep up with it long enough for it to become a habit. Hopefully, writing 250 words per day will get me past the "writer's block" that typically stops people from producing content. Then again, I may end up with a bunch of "stream of consciousness" articles with no real form or value. My goal may be unclear, but it is something along the lines of providing interesting and informative articles that teach you something new, not to provide a running catalog of random thoughts I've had throughout my days.

There are a few steps you can take to creating your daily discipline and making sure it sticks.

# Do it at the same time every day

For me, the best time to do some writing is first thing in the morning. The rest of the day is a toss-up for me, and I never really know if I'll have time at the end of the day, or just crash into bed. It only takes me five or ten minutes to get to my goal, so it's easy to fit into my morning routine before leaving for work.

# A Problem

I make time for writing every day, but sometimes have trouble getting all of these articles edited. Writing is rewriting, so if I'm always generating 250 brand new words, when will I ever have time to edit?

I'm considering modifying my goal to allow 250 words per day, or finish and publish and article. Editing my articles may not add too much to word count, but I usually end up rephrasing just about everything, coming out with a totally different article at the end of it all. The first, fast writeup gets my thoughts down and usually establishes a solid structure to the article. Then, the editing process allows me to fix everything up and make it all flow smoothly.

When I have four articles in my drafts, I find it hard to concentrate and figure out which to publish. Some are just sitting there, basically done but in need of editing. In order to meet my 250 words, I would have to start an entirely new topic, thus further fracturing my focus.

I will continue my 250 daily for two weeks (14 days) and then switch over. It's all a matter of finding what works best for you.

# Ship Often

In Linchpin, the importance of shipping is stressed. I am definitely the type of person to crave perfection before showing an article to the world. It took me some time, and some reading, to figure out that this perfectionism is rooted in fear.

My goal is to be more prolific with my writing. In other words, write a lot, and I'll learn how to write better along the way.

# Second Thoughts

Actually, I'm here on Day 14, and I find myself struggling to get through these words. So much time spent writing and so little time editing has led me to a backlog of drafts. There's also the issue of the articles that I do finish being lower in quality. There's something about writing at 6:00 am, before you even get out of bed, that makes your thoughts appear in strange order.

My need to have a rote daily habit for everything, a streak that I can't break, sometimes ends up backfiring. I definitely did a lot more writing than I usually do these past two weeks, and it was fun. I also managed to write an article that got a lot more attention than I expected.

I've grown through this process. The next step is to fine-tune this - instead of just soldiering on, I'll have to modify this habit so it works the best it possibly can. Process improvement, baby!

The way to go may be a daily writing session. Instead of measuring progress in words, it should be in something else. Perhaps it will be in time invested, since time tends to be a big limiting factor for me. If I could invest just 20 minutes a day of focused work into my writing, I think I would see even greater improvements than I do writing 250 words per day. I could use a pomodoro timer to get it done! Not to mention, this would make it much easier to set weekly, monthly, and yearly goals for articles published. If I have a weekly goal for getting a specific article written, I can direct all 20 to 25 minutes of writing on that article that needs to go out the door, instead of concentrating on banging out yet another tarnished 250 words.

I also need a better workflow. Copying a draft from Medium to my blog, reformatting it, importing back from my blog, and reformatting again is just not working out for me.

So, now I'm on the 20 minute regimen. I almost stopped writing, but then realized that I can't just push for 2 weeks and expect results. I have to keep going over time.

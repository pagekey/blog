Python is well-known for its flexible and easy interface for processing data. One essential part of that interface is the various math libraries provided. These easy-to-use libraries may be a part of why so many easy-to-use AI libraries are implemented in Python! [Todo: I completely made that up, so maybe delete it]

We're going to cover a few of the most important math functions that you can use in Python.

# Basic Operators

+,-,/,*,**, ... ?

# Trigonometry

sin, cos, tan, atan, atan2, acos, asin

# Special Math

??? Cool functions?

Calculus?

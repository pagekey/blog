Typically, people don't go about their day thinking about design and implementation. It's usually a discussion limited to engineers, programmers, developers, or project managers. In spite of this, these two concepts can apply to just about everything in your daily life. Learning to think about things in these terms may give you a new perspective.

One unorthodox application of these ideas would be to the act of writing. As I write, I find myself performing two distinct activities, whether I attempt to separate them or not. Design is figuring out which ideas I would like to convey, how I want to convey them, and what the feel should be - it's the big picture. **Outlining** is a design activity that really helps me bring my writing together.

On the other side of the coin is the implementation of my writing. It's what I'm doing right now - with my ideas more or less figured out, I'm relentlessly beating the words out of the keyboard, giving life to the skeleton of thoughts that I had previously formed.

What do these two concepts really mean? Google can help us with the definitions:

> Design (v). Decide upon the look and functioning of (a building, garment, or other object), typically by making a detailed drawing of it.

> Implementation (n). The process of putting a decision or plan into effect; execution.

As you can see, even the definition of design acknowledges that it applies to many different contexts: buildings, garments, electronics, musical instruments, video games, articles, fantasy football leagues - everything!

With these concepts in mind, my recommendation would be to focus on design when you can. Whether you know it or not, it's happening behind the scenes in your head. By realizing what's happening, you can take control and ensure that the end result is exactly what you envisioned!

# Benefits of a Design Focus

Like I mentioned above, the control that you get over your end result when focusing on design is invaluable.

Implementation becomes much easier when you have a clear and concise design.

[anecdote about web design]For example, I used to try to implement first, think later when it came to my website designs for [PageKey Solutions](http://pagekeysolutions.com/).

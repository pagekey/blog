  <h1>Career, Year One: 8 Lessons Learned</h1>

<div><p><img alt="Year One Circled on Calendar" src="../2018/career-year-one/career-year-one.jpeg"></p>
<p>Ever since I started my career as a computer engineer last summer, I‚Äôve been bombarded by lessons of all types, both from my many smart coworkers and from experience. Moving from the comfy classroom that had been my second home since kindergarten to a full-fledged professional work environment, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel excited, intimidated, confused, and enthused‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsometimes all at the same time! When I started out, I had no idea what I was doing, but a few seasoned mentors guided me in figuring out the basics. My goal is to share what I found out, so that your first year at work can be as interesting and productive as mine was!</p>

<h2 id="1-communication-and-documentation-our-bread-and-butter">1. Communication and Documentation: Our Bread and Butter</h2>
<p>Take a moment to think back to English class. It‚Äôs the final semester, and your hand trembles a little bit as you hand your homework in.</p>
<p>"There it goes," you think. "My last paper ever!"</p>
<p>Now snap out of it. I hate to break it to you, but you‚Äôre not done with writing. It‚Äôs an essential part of getting your ideas across and getting things done. There‚Äôs plenty more where that came from!</p>
<p>Not to worry, though. Odds are you‚Äôve been communicating effectively for years. With just a small amount of daily effort directed toward sharpening those skills, you‚Äôll find yourself with a new edge in the workplace, opening doors you didn‚Äôt even know were there.</p>
<p>I was initially very surprised at how hard it could be to really communicate at work. My habit of taking notes from textbooks was built on the assumption that everything in those books had been verified, and that it was just a matter of absorbing the information. On the contrary, life in the office is fast paced, and nobody has time to double- and triple-check their work or to write a novel on the topic before making a change. As development takes place, modifications to products are discussed in a whirlwind of emails, IMs, and phone calls, sometimes with little else left behind to describe the final result.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for a way to immediately provide value as a new hire, start documenting things. There are likely many processes that have yet to be documented, and still more details of the organization that are just "understood" by people who‚Äôve been around for years. New hires are tasked with finding their place in the organization and coming up to speed with all of these cultural conundrums. By documenting your journey, you‚Äôll save time (and company money) for the next person who tries to do it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also helpful to realize that what you‚Äôre writing may seem self-explanatory to you, but someone trying to understand your writing may have a different skill set. They will appreciate that you took the time to write it all down.</p>
<h2 id="2-stick-with-it-even-when-its-not-fun">2. Stick With It (Even when it‚Äôs not fun)</h2>
<p>It didn‚Äôt take me long to realize that having a full time job isn‚Äôt always a party. There have been plenty of times when I felt bogged down, bored, or overwhelmed with the tasks I was working on at the time.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve been in this situation, you‚Äôve probably had wild thoughts run through your head:</p>
<p><em>I‚Äôm stuck, so I must be terrible at this!</em></p>
<p><em>I‚Äôll do anything to get away from this one stupid task!</em></p>
<p><em>I have to check my email. Let me go see if my lead has anything new to do.</em></p>
<p><em>This is taking way too long‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs never going to get done.</em></p>
<p><em>I need to change careers, now!</em></p>
<p>It‚Äôs not as bad as you think. The fact is that your assignments at work will sometimes take longer than you want them to. There is a multitude of factors out of your control that can and will stop you from finishing what you‚Äôre working on. You may have to wait for someone to get back in the office to approve your request, or maybe you just have to grind through a sticky technical issue that won‚Äôt budge.</p>
<p>Regardless of what‚Äôs bugging you at the time, the point is you can‚Äôt just quit. For those tough tech problems, continue working on it, even if it feels useless. If you‚Äôve really reached a blocker, don‚Äôt just sit there. Take a second to evaluate your priorities (more on this later) and move forward. Give it some time to percolate in the back of your mind, and maybe ask someone else for their take on the issue.</p>
<h2 id="3-faster-isnt-always-better">3. Faster Isn‚Äôt Always Better</h2>
<p>When I started out last August, I sprinted into my new position. Fresh out of college, I entered the role eager and hungry, ready to prove myself and get as much done as possible. At first, this worked well. There was plenty to learn from my initial tasking, and when I got bored, there was always someone new to talk to and learn from. There wasn‚Äôt much for me to do in the beginning, as I had a lot to learn before I could truly provide value to my department. As for the tasks I did receive, I chased them without reserve, beating them into submission and over-delivering as much as I could.</p>
<p>As the tasks stacked up, my enthusiasm waned. I started getting pulled away and distracted; after starting to pour myself into the intricate details of a scripting issue, I would be interrupted by someone stopping by my desk to discuss something entirely unrelated. In response, I began to rush through everything on my list, feeling obliged to complete everything that was handed to me. As one may expect, this had a poor effect on the quality of my work. Far from setting myself apart with the results I provided, I had to cut corners and gave barely enough time to each individual task. I felt like I was juggling six plates, and it wouldn‚Äôt be too long before I dropped one.</p>
<p>As the old adage goes, haste makes waste. If you find yourself rushing to get more things done, consider taking a deep breath, stopping everything, and re-evaluating what‚Äôs on your plate, why you‚Äôre working on it, and how you‚Äôll get it done. In other words, prioritize your work.</p>
<h2 id="4-the-one-thing-focus-and-prioritizing">4. The One Thing: Focus and Prioritizing</h2>
<p>The book I read this year that had the biggest effect on my work was <a href="https://amzn.to/3PjG88N">The One Thing by Gary Keller</a>. The ideas in this book helped me realize the key to solving many of the problems I was experiencing in the office: <strong>You can only concentrate on one thing at a time.</strong> Really. In his book, Keller explains that it‚Äôs actually impossible to concentrate on more than one thing at a time, so we should stop trying.</p>
<p>To borrow one of his examples, think of your mind as a computer processor. While your computer may appear to be doing many things simultaneously, the processor is actually only executing one instruction at a time, switching between any number of processes very quickly. This works great for computers; as it turns out, they are far better at switching between tasks than we are. For a human to switch, it‚Äôs very inefficient. We have to stop what we‚Äôre working on, get all of the context ready, both in our minds and on our desks, and find a starting point. More task switching means more time wasted, so it‚Äôs best to choose the most important thing on your list and stay with it until it‚Äôs done.</p>
<p>Another helpful lesson intoned by Keller was that nothing is equal. For any two tasks, one of them is more important than the other to you, no matter what. Since their priority can‚Äôt be exactly the same, prioritizing should give you a definite path forward when you‚Äôre stuck. At any given time, <strong>one</strong> task on your list is the most important. This is the one you should work on. In doing so, the other items on the list may resolve themselves.</p>
<p>When I finally came up with a system of prioritizing tasks, my productivity skyrocketed. It was simple, but effective. I made a <a href="../kanban-board-onenote/">"Board" in OneNote</a> where I threw all of my tasks, big or small, from anyone or anything that may require my attention. After that, I make use of three lists‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTo Do, Complete This Week, and Completed. Each list will show the project, task description, and priority.</p>
<p>This system allows me to see everything I have been asked to do at a glance. By throwing everything in there, I won‚Äôt forget tasks. By frequently dragging-and-dropping tasks to prioritize, I ensure that whenever possible, I‚Äôm working on the "One Thing" that is the most important to complete at the time.</p>
<p>A list of twenty tasks is much less daunting with this method‚Äî instead of being stuck worrying about how you‚Äôll get everything done, you prioritize, pick your top task, and go. Simple.</p>
<h2 id="5-not-enough-work-find-some">5. Not Enough Work? Find Some!</h2>
<p>As a new engineer at my company, I often found myself running out of tasks. The original project I was assigned to had begun to wind down, and I was finishing my assigned work fairly quickly, leaving more and more space between tasks.</p>
<p>When everything on your list is done, there is temptation to sit and enjoy the feeling of completion. I finished everything I was assigned, so I‚Äôm done, right? It‚Äôs like school‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääclass is over early. Or is it?</p>
<p>This is another stark contrast between school and work. At school, if you check all the boxes on the rubric, you‚Äôre free to go. At work, though, you have to put in 40 or more hours per week; you can‚Äôt just leave because you‚Äôre bored and you sent your one email for the day. Since you‚Äôll have to be around anyway, you may as well get engaged in something that will benefit yourself and others!</p>
<p>I would recommend two routes in your quest for finding work. The first one requires only you. If you‚Äôre between tasks, don‚Äôt waste those minutes‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälook something up online that you didn‚Äôt know before, and practice a skill if you can. This means checking out a few lines of that new programming language, or brushing up on pivot tables in Excel. It could also be less technical tasks, like learning a few phrases of a foreign language relevant to your field. Be sure not to get too lost in this one; while these skills are helpful and will make you a better employee, you‚Äôre really at work to apply those skills, not read up on them!</p>
<p>That‚Äôs when you should move onto the second route: Seeking out work. This is something that can be nerve-wracking and probably out of your comfort zone. However, this is also where a lot of the fun is. Put on your detective hat and figure out where exactly there is a labor deficit in your organization. Who or what needs extra attention to be working at peak efficiency?</p>
<p>If you pursue this when you have time, you‚Äôll have the added benefit of getting to know more people. People who have been around for a while will probably appreciate the help.</p>
<h2 id="6-take-the-initiative-take-the-risk">6. Take the Initiative, Take the Risk</h2>
<p>Another great read that has helped my career was <a href="https://amzn.to/3Mbb8pv">Linchpin by Seth Godin</a>. This is a book about the mindset you hold toward your work. Instead of bringing only what your job description describes with you to the office, the book suggests that everyone has art that, if they choose to give it, can move things forward by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre someone with a passion for graphic design, and you‚Äôve recently entered a job that involves compiling financial records. At the surface level, it certainly doesn‚Äôt seem like those two things have a lot in common. In fact, it appears almost impossible to link the two. If you‚Äôre not making the effort, it‚Äôs not going to happen. But if you get creative and think of everything as an opportunity, you‚Äôll find a way.</p>
<p>The time has come‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäQuarter 3 is over, and you‚Äôre just finishing up the status package to present to others in your group. With the presentation looming, you stare at slide after slide of white on black text, bar graphs, and cheesy pre-made clip art.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity, you use your love of visual design to create custom icons and diagrams for key slides, illustrating the information in a new way and driving the point home. Your manager is so impressed that she pushes for your designs to be included on future company marketing material, both internally and for customers.</p>
<p>This is your art. Your unusual spin on a normally dry topic adds a welcome streak of color, just enough to brighten the day of your audience. Even if this takes up more time than just doing the bare minimum, a little bit of extra effort spent doing something you love won‚Äôt feel like a pile of work. On the contrary, you‚Äôll probably enjoy the time and produce a better end-result.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to be an artist to bring art to work, though. It could be through interpersonal communication, creating new ideas, and so much more. (If you‚Äôre still struggling to understand what your art is, read Seth‚Äôs <a href="https://amzn.to/3Mbb8pv">book</a>)</p>
<p>For me, this meant bringing a love of programming into a job that didn‚Äôt directly require it. By finding ways to apply my passion, I was able to contribute to projects in ways that others found difficult. As a side effect, the interest I developed in low-level computing ended up teaching me many lessons that would come in useful down the road.</p>
<h2 id="7-fear-is-a-signpost">7. Fear Is A Signpost</h2>
<p>At this point, you may be asking, "If everyone has all this art to give, why don‚Äôt more people use it?"</p>
<p>The answer may come as a surprise: Fear. While living in your comfort zone is very enticing, Godin stresses that all of the magic happens outside of it. Feel a little scared to pick up the phone and call a client? Good, do it anyway. Does giving presentations make your knees shake? All the more reason to give it a try. Do you have an idea, but are afraid of being ridiculed for bringing it forward? Take a deep breath, gather yourself, and put it out there.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs in this way that your fear is a signpost‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälearn to listen to it. If you‚Äôre afraid of something, it may be just what you need to do in order to grow. Run towards it, not away. Whenever you can, push past the little critic in the back of your head and do something that scares you.</p>
<h2 id="8-keep-moving-forward">8. Keep Moving Forward</h2>
<p>Sometimes, I feel like I‚Äôm treading water. There are days when I can do nothing more than stare a problem right in the eye, bewildered as to what the solution may be. Then, miraculously, things will fall into place and the solution will reveal itself. It may take some pondering, or coming back to the problem with a fresh mindset. Either way, the solution will come with persistence.</p>
<p>An essential takeaway is that when you‚Äôre struggling with an issue, you‚Äôre still making progress. As Jeff Olson argues in <a href="https://amzn.to/3PhY0kw">The Slight Edge</a>, there is no such thing as a breakthrough. When you finally solve the problem, it‚Äôs no miracle; it is the sum of all your efforts finally coming to fruition. Make just a little bit of progress, every single day, even when you don‚Äôt feel like it. Your daily efforts are much like the compound interest that (hopefully!) keeps your savings on the uptick. If you let it, this principle will permeate into every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>On another note, you may find it valuable to carefully consider some daily disciplines that you can build. What can you chip away at every single day to move towards your goal? How can you become better at what you do before the sun sets? These are the questions that will keep you on track to getting what you want out of your career.</p>
<h2 id="the-tip-of-the-iceberg">The Tip of the Iceberg</h2>
<p>As some friends have joked, I‚Äôve got one year down, 45 to go. I‚Äôve just scratched the surface of my career, so there‚Äôs a whole lot more that I need to learn. In summary, Year One has showed me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Communication is essential. Learn it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stick with it, even when it‚Äôs not fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faster isn‚Äôt always better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to prioritize your work, and focus on the most important thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find work when everything else is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the initiative. Go beyond the bare minimum and add your own touch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use fear as a signpost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep moving forward.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, some of these points have given you a new outlook on your work day. Keep them in mind moving forward, and if you find anything else out along the way, be sure to let me know!</p></div>

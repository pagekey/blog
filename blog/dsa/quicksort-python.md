In this video, we learn the ins and outs of Quicksort, a sorting algorithm that will come in handy in many situations. We go over theory, and then visualize the entire sorting process from start to finish.

We cover the quicksort method in general, as well as two partition schemes: Lomuto and Hoare methods.

Lomuto is simpler, but the Hoare method, named for Quicksort's inventor, C.A.R. Hoare, is more efficient.

The full implementation in Python can be found at the following link:

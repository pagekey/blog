Version 2.2.2 brings some new changes since our last dev log:
1. Code refactor
2. Web landing page
3. Articles list - done/in progress
4. Article "show" page with info/actions to take
5. Article translator improvements
6. My Words
7. Users list
8. Activity Log

In other news, https://pagekeysolutions.com has been redesigned and now includes links to everything we're working on.

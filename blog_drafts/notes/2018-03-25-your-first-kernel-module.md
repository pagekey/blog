Writing Your First Kernel Module

Centos or Ubuntu... Whichever will compile.

Worked on Ubuntu!
Standard tutorial followed in Linux docs:
https://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/x121.html

Hello world, goodbye world in dmesg
insmod, rmmod, modinfo all work

That was too easy.
Now:
* Build hello world kernel module (already done)
  * Use _ _ init and _ _ exit macros
* Create a very simple device or device file
* That's it

Creating device
Hmmm...

Jumping in with the rough draft.

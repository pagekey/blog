Here's everything you could possibly want to know about my latest project, a homegrown Semantic Versioning automation tool!

Instead of spending 20 minutes to figure out how to use existing tools, I decided to spend two months writing my own, refining it, and documenting it to make it easy to use and maintain. :)

Hope this helps you in some way!

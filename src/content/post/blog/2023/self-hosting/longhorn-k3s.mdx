Let's wrangle us some Longhorn and install it on our cluster.

## Installing Longhorn

Source: https://docs.k3s.io/storage

K3s comes with PVC support out of the box, but we want Longhorn because it's better. It's easy to instlal - just run this:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v1.5.1/deploy/longhorn.yaml
```

Then make sure all of the Longhorn pods come up without issue. Make sure they all show "Running" as their status.

```bash
kubectl get pod -n longhorn-system
```

## Accessing the Longhorn UI

Check the video for exact details on this. To access the Longhorn UI, we have to expose a NodePort for it. Run this to edit the frontend service:

```bash
kubectl edit service -n longhorn-system longhorn-frontend
```

Change the line that says `type: ClusterIP` to `type: NodePort`. Then add a `nodePort: 30080` under the only entry in the `ports:` list.

Finally, access the UI by going to your cluster's public IP on that port. For example, if you cluster is accessible on your network via the IP address 10.0.0.184, you'd visit http://10.0.0.184:30080 in your browser to see the UI.

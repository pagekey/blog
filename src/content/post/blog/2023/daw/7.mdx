This video is a wild goose chase to figure out why I can't seem to calculate the start/end sample of notes properly. 

import BlogYoutubeVideo from '~/components/common/BlogYoutubeVideo.astro';

<BlogYoutubeVideo videoId="5pLZ6SSG5XE" />

### Timestamps

- 0:00 Intro / Working demo
- 0:44 Feeling defeated (late at night)
- 1:28 A fresh start (in the morning)
- 2:18 Plenty of print statements
- 2:44 Calculating it by hand, on paper
- 3:06 Refactored: still wrong, but closer
- 4:22 BPM driving me insane
- 4:46 Fixed BPM equation (again)
- 6:40 More print statements & hair pulling
- 7:12 THE FIX! 8 CHARACTERS
- 7:33 How it should sound
- 7:54 Piano demo
- 8:05 Visualizing note addition in Audacity
- 9:19 Attempting to fix clipping, Roadmap
- 10:01 New architecture idea
- 10:50 Outro

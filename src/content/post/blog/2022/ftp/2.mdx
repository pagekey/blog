## Quick Notes
- Intro
	- If you're brand new to programming, make a website
		- You use websites every day
- Concepts
	- HTML, CSS, JS are all linked together - you learn them all at the same time
	- Websites are trees
		- DOM: The logical tree representation of a website
	- HTML: The content - text, images, etc.
	- CSS: How it looks, styling
	- JavaScript: Behavior
- Follow Along
	- Go to [pagekey.io](https://pagekey.io) or any website
	- Right click, press "Inspect" to open developer tools
- Top: HTML
	- Can change content in any of the elements (hack the school website trick)
- Middle: CSS
	- Can see each rule and the styles applied by that rule
	- The dot in CSS selects elements with "class=NAME"
		- Example: `.myClass` selects elements such as `<div class="myClass"></div>`
- Bottom: JavaScript console
	- `console.log("Hello World")`
	- Get reference to footer:
		- `var footer = document.querySelector(".FooterClassName")`

# PageKey Blog

- Render the blog with `./render.bash` - this will merge the language sites and put the final result in the `build` dir, ready to be hosted.
- ?? Preview the blog for each language: `cd en; mkdocs serve`
  - ?? The tmp mkdocs config in that folder will be overwritten by the one in `common` at build time, it's just in there for live reload purposes

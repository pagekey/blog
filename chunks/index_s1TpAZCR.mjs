Looking at French flashcards will not improve your ability to tell a story in French, nor will it sharpen your wits in daily French conversation. When viewed through this lens, it becomes clear that DuoLingo is teaching us a very narrow range of skills, much like the dreaded classroom-based learning we all remember so sorely from high school and college.

The point is that the process would be treated as something personal, experienced differently by everyone who attempts it.

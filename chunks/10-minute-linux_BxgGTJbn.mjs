Still others may have been stuck with nothing more than a cell phone, or even just a TI-84 calculator.\n\nRegardless of your humble beginnings, I want to congratulate you on taking things to the next level by jumping headfirst into the world of Linux. Whatever your reason for dipping your toes in these waters, I'm sure you won't regret it! Anyone involved with computers will almost certainly encounter Linux at some point in their career, so now is the time for you to get ahead of things and figure out how to use the dang thing!\n\nAll you'll need is a little patience and about 10 minutes to get started! Read on.\n\nDisclaimer: the video is 10 minutes, but the article may be a bit more verbose. :)\n\nimport BlogYoutubeVideo from '~/components/common/BlogYoutubeVideo.astro';\n\n<BlogYoutubeVideo videoId=\"XKvmgtOidYU\" />\n\n## Making Moves (Navigating the System)\n\nOne of the first things you need to know how to do when you're learning to use the computer is how to move around. For Windows or Mac, everything is graphical. Some Linux distributions have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) as well, but Real Linux happens on the command line. From now on, we're throwing off the GUI security blanket and diving straight into the command-line!\n\n### `ls`\n\nBy far, the most common command on Linux is `ls`, which `l`i`s`ts the files in the current directory. Instead of opening a window and seeing a folder's files there, you'll instead be in a terminal window whose *current working directory* is set to some folder on your hard drive. `ls` shows you everything in that folder.\n\nHere is an example of what using `ls` may look like:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nfile1.txt  file2.txt  image.jpg\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nIn the above, you can see that we typed `ls` and hit enter, showing the contents of our current folder. As it turns out, the folder contains three files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `image.jpg`.\n\nThe `ls` command on its own hides files that start with a \"`.`\". To really see **all** the files, you can use `ls -a`:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls -a\n.  ..  file1.txt  file2.txt  image.jpg\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nYou can view extra information about the files with the **long** version of the command, `ls -l`:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw-r--r-- 1 steve steve 0 Nov 28 14:11 file1.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 steve steve 0 Nov 28 14:11 file2.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 steve steve 0 Nov 28 14:11 image.jpg\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nYou can use them together with `ls -al` (or `ls -la`):\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls -al\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 steve steve 4096 Nov 28 14:11 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 28 steve steve 4096 Nov 28 12:38 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 steve steve    0 Nov 28 14:11 file1.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 steve steve    0 Nov 28 14:11 file2.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 steve steve    0 Nov 28 14:11 image.jpg\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\n### `cd`\n\nWhat if there's nothing in this folder that we're particularly interested in? Are we out of luck?\n\nNo! The `cd` command, or **current directory**, will come to the rescue! We use this command to change the current working directory to somewhere else on the system.\n\nFor example, say I need a break from work. In that case, I'll head over to my games folder:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:games$ cd /home/steve/games\nsteve@surface01:games$ ls\ncod.sh  minecraft.sh\nsteve@surface01:games$\n```\n\nAs you can see, typing `ls` again now shows the files inside the **games** folder in my home directory. If the path `/home/steve/does_not_exist` isn't a real folder on your computer, you'll get an error:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ cd /home/steve/does_not_exist\n-bash: cd: /home/steve/does_not_exist: No such file or directory\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nNotice how the path above begins with a slash (\"`/`\"). When you see this in Linux, it's called an **absolute path**. This means that you're giving the *exact* path to a file or folder on your system. The alternative is to use a **relative path**, which we'll talk about below.\n\n### `pwd`\n\nIn case you get completely turned around, you can use the `pwd` command, or **print working directory**, to tell you exactly where you are on the computer.\n\nAfter running the `cd` command in the above example, this is the output of the `pwd` command:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ cd /home/steve/games\nsteve@surface01:games$ pwd\n/home/steve/games\nsteve@surface01:games$\n```\n\n### Relative Paths\n\nThere are two special directories you'll want to worry about: `.` and `..`. Yes, you read that right - they're called \"dot\" and \"dot dot\". What the heck does that mean?\n\nThe single dot, `.`, stands for the **current directory**. The double dot, `..`, stands for the **parent directory**. Anything that uses one of these two special folders, or that does not begin with a slash, is considered a **relative path**.\n\nSay that we're back in my `games` folder, and I want to move up a folder into the `/home/steve` directory. One way to do this would be to type the whole path in the command, as `cd /home/steve`. However, you might as well save your fingers some work! Just type `cd ..` and it will do the same job.\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:games$ pwd\n/home/steve/games\nsteve@surface01:games$ cd ..\nsteve@surface01:~$ pwd\n/home/steve\nsteve@surface01:~$\nsteve@surface01:~$ cd games\nsteve@surface01:games$ pwd\n/home/steve/games\nsteve@surface01:games$\n```\n\nIt may not seem like a big deal, but paths can get quite long. When you're 20 folders deep, you definitely won't want to type the entire path out to move up a folder!\n\nAnother powerful part of this is that you can chain the dot-folders. To move up two directories instead of one, it's as easy as:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:games$ pwd\n/home/steve/games\nsteve@surface01:games$ cd ../..\nsteve@surface01:home$ pwd\n/home\nsteve@surface01:home$\n```\n\nNotice that I moved from `/home/steve/games` all the way up to `/home`. Much quicker!\n\nNow that you now know the basics of moving around, let's get our hands dirty and mess with some files.\n\n## Get Organized! (File Manipulation)\n\n### `cat`\n\nThe fluffiest of all Linux commands, `cat` is also one of the most useful. It's job is not to eat all of your kibble or crawl on your keyboard, but instead to **output the contents of any file on your computer**. This is handy if you want to check what's inside of something without popping open a text editor, but it's also priceless when using **piping**, discussed below.\n\nIt's incredibly simple to use. Just type `cat <name_of_file>`. Here's an example - say that I keep my dog's name is a text file in case I forget it:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\ndog_name.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ cat dog_name.txt\nDoggo\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nAs you can see, we've printed the contents of `dog_name.txt` to the terminal for all the world to see!\n\n### `touch`\n\nIf you need to create an empty file, maybe as a placeholder or just to prove that you have permission to do it, you can use the touch command.\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$ touch my_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nmy_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ cat my_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nThere it is!\n\n### `mkdir`\n\nThe `mkdir` command lets you **make a directory**. Check it out:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nmy_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mkdir folder1\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nfolder1  my_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ touch folder1/other_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ cd folder1/\nsteve@surface01:folder1$ ls\nother_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder1$ cd ..\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nfolder1  my_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nIf you need to make multiple nested directories all at once, you'll have to use `mkdir -p`.\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mkdir lots/of/nested/folders\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘lots/of/nested/folders’: No such file or directory\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mkdir -p lots/of/nested/folders\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nlots\nsteve@surface01:folder$ du -a\n4       ./lots/of/nested/folders\n8       ./lots/of/nested\n12      ./lots/of\n16      ./lots\n20      .\nsteve@surface01:folder$ find .\n.\n./lots\n./lots/of\n./lots/of/nested\n./lots/of/nested/folders\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nNotice that we used the `du -a` command to see all of the folders. While `du` stands for **disk utilization**, it can also be helpful to show an entire folder structure rather than a single directory. Another option to perform the same task is `find .`.\n\n### `rmdir`\n\nIf you want to **remove a directory**, `rmdir` is the way to go.\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mkdir img\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nimg\nsteve@surface01:folder$ rmdir img\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nIt doesn't always work though. What if the directory has something in it?\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mkdir testdir\nsteve@surface01:folder$ touch testdir/testfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ find .\n.\n./testdir\n./testdir/testfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ rmdir testdir\nrmdir: failed to remove 'testdir': Directory not empty\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\ntestdir\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nIn order to delete a directory with something in it, we'll have to use the `rm` command, explained below.\n\n### `mv`\n\nThe `mv` command serves two purposes. You can **move** a file, and you can also **rename** a file. If you think about it, this is pretty much the same thing anyway. If you rename a file, it's a lot like you're moving it to a new path in the same directory.\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ touch myfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nmyfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mv myfile.txt not_my_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nnot_my_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\n### `rm`\n\nSadly, we have to let some of our files go sometimes. When that time comes, `rm` lets you **remove files**.\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nnot_my_file.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ rm not_my_file.txt\nrm: remove regular empty file 'not_my_file.txt'? y\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nSo long!\n\nWhat if you want to **remove a directory**? You'll have to use `rm -r` instead. The `-r` stands for **recursive**.\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mkdir testdir\nsteve@surface01:folder$ touch testdir/testfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ find .\n.\n./testdir\n./testdir/testfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ rm -r testdir\nrm: descend into directory 'testdir'? y\nrm: remove regular empty file 'testdir/testfile.txt'? y\nrm: remove directory 'testdir'? y\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\nNotice how it asks you for *every single file*. If you're deleting a directory with thousands of files, this is not going to work. To **force** it to delete the files without asking, add `-f` to the command:\n\n```bash\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$ mkdir testdir\nsteve@surface01:folder$ touch testdir/testfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ find .\n.\n./testdir\n./testdir/testfile.txt\nsteve@surface01:folder$ rm -rf testdir\nsteve@surface01:folder$ ls\nsteve@surface01:folder$\n```\n\n**Be careful with this one**, as you can damage your system beyond repair. **Never run anything like `rm -rf /`** as you will delete everything (assuming you have permission) and brick your system. It's like deleting system32 on Windows - anyone telling you to run this command does not have good intentions!\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nWell done - you now know the basics of navigating around a Linux system.\n";

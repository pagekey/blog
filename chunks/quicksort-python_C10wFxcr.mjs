We go over theory, and then visualize the entire sorting process from start to finish.\n\nimport BlogYoutubeVideo from '~/components/common/BlogYoutubeVideo.astro';\n\n<BlogYoutubeVideo videoId=\"OSD4b-ih6Kc\" />\n\nWe cover the quicksort method in general, as well as two partition schemes: Lomuto and Hoare methods.\n\nLomuto is simpler, but the Hoare method, named for Quicksort's inventor, C.A.R. Hoare, is more efficient.\n\nThe full implementation in Python can be found at the following link:\n\n[https://github.com/pagekeysolutions/education/tree/master/Sorts](https://github.com/pagekeysolutions/education/tree/master/Sorts)\n\nThank you for watching.";

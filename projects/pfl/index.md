# Plaintext for Life (PFL) Fitness App

Plaintext for Life (PFL) is a fitness app developed and extensively documented for educational purposes. The goal is to build an app that allows you to manage your own workouts effectively, keeping you motivated, and to provide easy import/export of your fitness data - in plaintext, for life! Say goodbye to proprietary data formats and hello to a lifetime of fitness with this open source mobile app.

The app is developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a cross-platform mobile application framework developed by Google. Its cross platform support makes it easy to deploy the app to Android, iOS, and even Web, all from a single codebase.
